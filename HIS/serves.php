                Crown and bridges
                Both crowns and most bridges are fixed prosthetic devices. Unlike removable devices such as dentures, which you can take out and clean daily, crowns and bridges are cemented onto existing teeth or implants, and can only be removed by a dentist.

            <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
            <p>
                Dental implants are metal posts or frames that are surgically positioned into the jawbone beneath your gums. Once in place, they allow your dentist to mount replacement teeth onto them.

            <p>
                
                Removable partial dentures usually consist of replacement teeth attached to pink or gum-colored plastic bases. Depending on your needs, we will design a partial denture for you.

            <h3>Root Canal Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                
                Inside your tooth, beneath the white enamel and a hard layer called dentin, is a soft tissue called pulp. A fully developed tooth can survive without the pulp because the tooth continues to be nourished by the tissues surrounding it.

            <h3>Veneers</h3>
            <p>
                
                The right veneers are a quick way to a beautiful smile, and this treatment is perfect for people with teeth that are stained, chipped or have gaps. But veneers are an irreversible treatment, so having them placed is a big decision. Before you and your dentist decide the procedure is right for you.

            <h3>                 Dental Fillings
            </h3>
            <p>
               
A filling is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay back to its normal function and shape. When a dentist gives you a filling, he or she first removes the decayed tooth material, cleans the affected area, and then fills the cleaned out cavity with a filling material.
